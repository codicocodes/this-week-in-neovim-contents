> Survey to find out how people use Neovim built-in options

Have you ever wondered, which leader key people use the most? Is it default `\`, `<Space>`, `,`, or something else? And
how about answering the eternal question "Tabs or spaces?"? This survey aims to gather data which will help answer this
type of questions. And it needs your help!

It should take at most 5 minutes of your time. Basically: download Lua script
([with this source code](https://gist.github.com/echasnovski/493329c67050e9dcc5546815f31179d0)), source it inside your
regular Neovim instance, copy output, paste in Google Form question, and submit. More information is inside post and
submission form.

This is a new special plugin that allows to minimize the amount of data to read to understand the content. I was not
convinced at first… and after a couple of minutes, I was stunned to realize that actually works quite well! This is
probably more interesting if you are reading prose rather than code.

This is a plugin for those looking for a VSCode-like experience in Neovim.

Some of the unique features:

- A rich set of default plugins which make up an IDE experience:
- A panel which stacks plugins similar to VSCode:
- The ability to swap groups of plugins into panels, similar to VSCode:
- A well defined API for creating out-of-tree plugins and extending `nvim-ide`.

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

You probably know the `*` key, which allows you to search the word under your cursor. Pressing `n` will go to the next
occurrence, and pressing `N` will go backwards. If you press `*` on a word that is the last occurrenc in your buffer, it
will go back up to the top of your buffer to continue searching, probably moving your view by quite a lot of lines.

Did you know that there is a key that allows to search the word under your keyword immediatly in backwards mode?
Pressing `n` will continue searching backwards, and pressing `N` will go forward. That key is the `#` key!
