Even though that plugin was written a few months back, we never introduced it in TWiN, so here we go!
A plugin written by [@samjwill](https://github.com/samjwill) that leverages Neovim's built-in RPC
functionality to simplify opening files from within Neovim's terminal emulator without
unintentionally nesting sessions.

The plugin now supports Git commits, multiple sessions, and free from reliance on external tools!

This plugin wasn‚Äôt introduced before it was released.
A tiny (currently 337 LoC) collection of custom UI utilities, written by [@hood](https://github.com/hood), to make your
NeoVim workflow faster. It consists of two (ui-overrider, input-overrider) utilities which override Neovim's default
`vim.ui.select` and `vim.ui.input`, spawning a floating menu right where your cursor resides, and a
diagnostics-navigator utility to quickly navigate (and jump to) LSP diagnostics issues in the current buffer.

The plugin is also dependency free, now!

Portal is a plugin that aims to build upon and enhance existing jumplist motions (i.e. <kbd>c-o</kbd> and
<kbd>c-i</kbd>) by surfacing contextual information with the use of
[portals](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#portals), and providing multiple jump options by
means of [queries](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#queries). That is a very interesting new kind of moving around;
definitly worth a try!

A motionless motion plugin! Yep, that‚Äôs a thing. Take a motion plugin, like
[leap.nvim](https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim) or [hop.nvim](https://github.com/phaazon/hop.nvim), and make it
possible to yank, paste, and perform various actions using the typical hints, but without moving your cursor. Plugins
can provide that, but `easy-action` does it for various plugins with a different way (plugins like Leap and Hop might
already support it, or will, but it‚Äôs nice to see something doing it using plugins‚Äô API).

in the current buffer. Pretty convenient.

Have you migrated from [**nvim-lsp-installer**](https://github.com/williamboman/nvim-lsp-installer) to [**mason.nvim**](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim)? `nvim-lsp-installer` installed servers to a different location than `mason.nvim` - remember to clean up the old installation directory to free up disk space! The default installation directory of `nvim-lsp-installer` are:

- Unix: `~/.local/share/nvim/lsp_servers`
- Windows: `~\AppData\Local\nvim-data\lsp_servers`

These directories can safely be removed if you're no longer using `nvim-lsp-installer`!
