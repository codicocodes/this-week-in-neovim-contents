Flatten.nvim allows you to open files from a Neovim terminal buffer in your current Neovim session. It's easily 
configurable, and supports blocking so programs which need a pager / editor can use the current Neovim session as well. 
Goodbye nested Neovim instances!

There is a new `mini.splitjoin` module in `mini.nvim`. It implements functionality and mappings to split and join
arguments (regions inside brackets between allowed separators) under cursor. Mappings are dot-repeatable in Normal mode
and work in Visual mode. Has customizable pre and post hooks for both split and join. Works inside comments.

This plugin will enhance your Neovim experience by automatically toggling smoothly between relative and absolute line 
numbers in various Neovim events. This is useful when you want to take advantage of the information on those types of 
numbers in different situations.

tons of small performance and usability improvements. Check out the 
[GitHub Release Announcement](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim/releases/tag/v3.0.0) for more details of the

AstroNvim v3 has also brought the release of the 
[AstroNvim Community Repository](https://github.com/AstroNvim/astrocommunity) which aims to be a community lead plugin 
marketplace for users to build and share neovim plugin configurations specifically designed for AstroNvim. This can 
range from adding single plugins and colorschemes to setting up entire language support packs!
