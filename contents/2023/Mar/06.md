A hard fork of the original (now abandoned) [nvim-ts-rainbow](https://sr.ht/~p00f/nvim-ts-rainbow/). The goal was to 
create a hackable rainbow delimiter plugin which can be fully customized by the user through Lua.

It supports different queries per language to match different kinds of delimiters (e.g. tags in HTML) and different 
highlighting strategies. The two default strategies are `global` (highlights the entire buffer) and `local` (highlights 
only the part of the document containing the cursor).

> Bundle of ~~more than a dozen~~ *almost two dozen* new text objects for Neovim.

![nvim-various-textobjs](https://i.imgur.com/l08JDN2.png)

Since [introducing nvim-various-textobjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/zvnox9/introducing_nvimvarioustextobjs_a_plugin_bundling/), 
half a dozen additional text objects have been added:

- __restOfIndentation-textobj__: basically `ii`, but only from the cursor position downwards.
- __key-textobj__: Counterpart to the value-textobj. Key of a key-value-pair, or left-hand-side of a variable assignment.
- __entireBuffer-textobj__: a convenience text object representing the entire buffer.
- __url-textobj__: a link (`http…`) as text object. The readme also includes an
  [example snippet for using the url-textobj to create a smarter `gx`](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/nvim-various-textobjs#smart-alternative-to-gx).
- __shellPipe-textobj__: a command stdout is piped to.
- __toNextClosingBracket-textobj__: from the cursor position to the next `)`, `}`, or `]`. (This is essentially a replacement for the `%` motion-as-textobject, since I find it more intuitive this way.).
- Also new: the __subword-textobj__ now also recognizes parts of a camelCase word.

> Improved location list navigation with the use of portals

![portal_showcase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467016/222644459-264e22e7-496a-4d4e-bfcb-e96efda0003d.gif)

Portal.nvim has received a full plugin rewrite! This rewrite brings a host of new features, simplified user API, and 
plenty of code cleanup. A few notable changes:

- **Simplified** user command and lua API
- **Builtin** support for the `jumplist`, `changelist`, and `qflist` location lists
- **Ability** to [filter](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#filters) search results
- **Ability** to [query](https://github.com/cbochs/portal.nvim#portal-api) multiple location lists in a single search
