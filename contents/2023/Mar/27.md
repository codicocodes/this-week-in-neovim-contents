[Elijah Manor](https://twitter.com/elijahmanor) published a new YouTube video 
[Neovim Config Switcher](https://youtu.be/LkHjJlSgKZY) where he shows a new feature of Neovim nightly that allows for 
quickly switching between configurations. This can be useful if you want to experiment with new configs or swap between 
special setups.

`http.nvim` should be your weapon of choice when making plugins that have to call out to remote HTTP services. It's 
implemented as a native Lua module, no `curl` or `wget` required! It currently allows you to send and receive data as 
Lua strings (which can contain anything, including non-text data). There is also support for downloading files to a 
local path. WebSocket support is planned.

> Use the `w`, `e`, `b` motions like a spider.

The plugin offers alternatives to vim's `w`, `e`, and `b` motion which differ in two ways: 

1. __Subword Movement__: The movements happen by subwords, meaning it stops at the sub-parts of a CamelCase 
  (or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE or kebab-case) variable. 

  ```lua
  -- positions vim's `w` will move to
  local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
  --    ^              ^ ^
  
  -- positions spider's `w` will move to
  local myVariableName = FOO_BAR_BAZ
  --    ^ ^       ^    ^ ^   ^   ^
  ```
2. __Skipping Insignificant Punctuation__: A sequence of one or more punctuation characters is considered significant if 
  it is surrounded by whitespace and does not includes any non-punctuation characters. This speeds up the movement 
  across the line by reducing the number of mostly unnecessary stops.

  ```lua
  -- positions vim's `w` will move to
  if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
  -- ^  ^^   ^  ^^  ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^    ^  ^  ^ ^  ^ ^  ^  ^ ^  -> 21
  
  -- positions spider's `w` will move to
  if foo:find("%d") and foo == bar then print("[foo] has" .. bar) end
  -- ^   ^      ^   ^   ^   ^  ^   ^    ^       ^    ^    ^  ^    ^  -> 14
  ```
3. __Furthermore__
  - lightweight (~120 LoCs) & solely lua
  - works in normal, visual, and operater-pending mode
  - supports counts
  - zero-config (aside from adding the keymaps you want)
  - `ge` is also supported (not mentioned in the descriptions for the bad pun)

> The power of trees at your fingertips.

`mind.nvim` was a project started a while ago by [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) to be able to put _thoughts_ in
tree-like structures. The project gained some traction, but lately, [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) started to
rework the project as a standalone and experimental tool. Having those features available only to Neovim started to
sound off and not the direction [@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon) wants his software to go to.

For this reason, `mind.nvim` is now [archived](https://github.com/phaazon/mind.nvim#deprecation-and-archive-notice). Yo
u are advised to switch to another plugin if you are doing any kind of note taking or task management. The plugin was 
written with a BSD-3-Clause license, so feel free to fork it according to the license.

> Unofficial Codeium Nvim Plugin

There have been several contributions from users of the plugin:

- [@WillEhrendreich](https://github.com/WillEhrendreich) and [@ww-daniel-mora](https://github.com/ww-daniel-mora) helped 
  to get the plugin working on Windows.
- [@luismeyer95](https://github.com/luismeyer95) and [@dakata1337](https://github.com/dakata1337) reduced the spamminess 
  of errors.
- [@DieracDelta](https://github.com/DieracDelta), [@chrisgrieser](https://github.com/chrisgrieser), and 
  [@mauriciopoppe](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe) fixed various bugs.

Thanks everyone! On top of all these great contributions, optional support for [http.nvim](#http.nvim) has been added 
(see the readme).

> üó∫Ô∏è A legend for your keymaps, commands, and autocmds, with which-key.nvim integration 

![legendary.nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8648891/200827633-7009f5f3-e126-491c-88bd-73a0287978c4.gif)

`legendary.nvim` now has an extensions API, so users can automatically load keymaps/commands/etc. managed by other 
plugins into `legendary.nvim`'s registry, so that they can be triggered from `legendary.nvim`'s UI. For example, to load 
all of `nvim-tree.lua`'s keymaps into `legendary.nvim`, all you have to do now is add the following configuration:

```lua
require('legendary').setup({
  extensions = {
    nvim_tree = true,
  },
})
```

There are a few built-in extensions currently, and 3rd party extensions can also be added by creating a Lua module under 
the `legendary.extensions.*` namespace. See the 
[documentation](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim/blob/master/doc/EXTENSIONS.md) for more information.
