The project could really use some awesome developers that have some free time and love that they can dedicate to 
maintaining the project. Up until recently, the author has been the primary person to triage issues, fix bugs, plan new 
features, etc. The plugin received lots of great contributions from the community, which is very much appreciated by
the author, but the project needs to continue growing and calls for someone to step up and take a lead role on the 
project. More than one person would even be better!

From the author:

> I don't have the same amount of free time that I had when I started the project, and I am no longer really keeping up 
> the way I should. I'm not looking to completely drop out of the project, but I would like to take a backseat if 
> there's anyone out there interested in being a maintainer.

The new `mini.basics` module of `mini.nvim` provides common configuration presets for options, mappings, and 
autocommands. After a single `require('mini.basics').setup()` you will get:

- Common options set: `termguicolors`, `number`, `ignorecase`, etc. Which ones are set is mostly based on 
  [results of the Neovim built-in options survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/zg44mm/results_of_neovim_builtin_options_survey_more_in/). 
  If you set option manually beforehand, it won't get changed.
- Mappings for common actions created (if you didn't manually create particular mapping beforehand):
    - `j`/`k` will move by visible lines.
    - `<C-s>` will save buffer.
    - `go`/`gO` will create empty line after/before cursor line.
    - Mappings like `\x` will toggle common options: `\w` toggles 'wrap', `\s` - 'spell', etc.
    - And many more.
- Common autocommands created: highlight on yank, start Terminal mode when opening built-in terminal, etc.

Minimally invasive session manager powered by `fzf-lua`: `nvim-possession` does _only_ what you need and no more, making 
managing sessions quick and visually appealing! Browse, create and delete sessions dynamically, add your statusline 
component and you are ready to go!

Sessions can also be loaded and saved automagically, and you can provide post-hooks callbacks to make sure your terminal 
windows and file managers and properly restored too!

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

We know how to compare changes in a file with the `HEAD` in our git repo. But how to compare changes in the current 
buffer with a related file on your disk, before it will be saved, if Git does not track this file yet?

_Bram Moolenaar_ took care of it in `usr_05.txt`. Here is an example with little improvements in Lua:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_create_user_command('DiffOrig', function()
  -- Get start buffer
  local start = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()

  -- `vnew` - Create empty vertical split window
  -- `set buftype=nofile` - Buffer is not related to a file, will not be written
  -- `0d_` - Remove an extra empty start row
  -- `diffthis` - Set diff mode to a new vertical split
  vim.cmd('vnew | set buftype=nofile | read ++edit # | 0d_ | diffthis')

  -- Get scratch buffer
  local scratch = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()

  -- `wincmd p` - Go to the start window
  -- `diffthis` - Set diff mode to a start window
  vim.cmd('wincmd p | diffthis')

  -- Map `q` for both buffers to exit diff view and delete scratch buffer
  for _, buf in ipairs({ scratch, start }) do
    vim.keymap.set('n', 'q', function()
      vim.api.nvim_buf_delete(scratch, { force = true })
      vim.keymap.del('n', 'q', { buffer = start })
    end, { buffer = buf })
  end
end, {})
```

More with `:h :DiffOrig`.
