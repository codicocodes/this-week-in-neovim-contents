`r/nvim` member and YouTuber [/u/elijah_manor](https://www.reddit.com/user/elijah_manor/) has made an informative and 
user friendly guide for [migrating from Packer.nvim to Lazy.nvim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqlxqpHs-aQ). Great 
for those of us who've been meaning to lazy load their plugins but were too… lazy to figure out how. The conversion is 
very simple, so if you don't want to commit to leaving Packer, it's a short process and very easy to convert back and 
forth to try it out. Thanks Elijah!

[@roobert](https://github.com/roobert) created a shell script to ease even further the contribution process to TWiN! The
script will do various things for you, mostly boilerplate, such as cloning the contents repository, ask for whether you
are adding a guide, new plugin, update of an existing plugin, etc. and will create the formatted skeleton for the entry.
Very good job and really appreciated!

A new take on an existing idea: a file explorer that lets you edit your filesystem like a buffer. This plugin takes the 
basic premise pioneered by [vidir](https://github.com/trapd00r/vidir) and refined by 
[dirbuf.nvim](https://github.com/elihunter173/dirbuf.nvim), and adds more capabilities. Notable features:

- Cross-directory move/copy operations
- Configurable columns (permissions, size, mtime, etc).
- Seamless interop with remote machines using ssh.

A plugin that enhances how you interact with macros.

- __Simplified controls__: One key to start and stop recording, a second key for playing the macro. Instead of 
  `qa … q @a @@`, you just do `q … q Q Q`.
- __Macro Breakpoints__ for easier debugging of macros. Breakpoints can also be set after the recording, and are 
  automatically ignored when triggering a macro with a count.
- __Status line components__: Particularly useful if you use `cmdheight=0` where the recording status is not visible.
- __Macro-to-mapping__: Yank a macro to your default register, with the keys "decoded" for keymaps.
- __Various quality-of-life features__ like notifications with macro content, the ability to cancel a recording, or a 
  command to edit macros.

[@luukvbaal](https://github.com/luukvbaal)'s new plugin takes advantage of the new recently merged 
[statsucol](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/20621) nightly feature that allows you to customize the gutter area 
the same way you can customize the statusline. The plugin provides "click-handlers for the fold, sign and line number 
segments in your 'statuscolumn' string respectively."

Another simple way to swap sibling elements in your code: `arguments`, `parameters`, `attributes`, `pairs in objects`, 
`array's items` e.t.c.

- No additional highlight – no thinking, just drag and drop.
- Keeps your cursor in the same place on the element where you started.
- If it is a binary expression – it can revert operator: `a >= b` to `b <= a`.
- Work with all sibling nodes which places on same line and separated by `allowed_separators` or space.

This new module of `mini.nvim` makes it easier to move any selection in any direction. Basically, you select text 
(charwise with `v`, linewise with `V`, blockwise with `CTRL-V`, or use current line in Normal mode) and press 
customizable mapping to move it in all four directions (left, right, down, up) while remembering your selection. Handles
both `v:count` and undo history.

> Melange is a warm colorscheme for Neovim and terminal emulators.

![melange-nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30883030/212500086-a6709213-c82a-4eca-8f3f-67fdc5c26f23.png)

The repository for Melange was renamed from `savq/melange` to `savq/melange-nvim`.
If you happen to use Melange, you should update how it's listed in your configuration.
GitHub still redirects the old URL, but better safe than sorry.

Melange itself had a big update this week that replaces the lush.nvim
implementation with direct calls to the Neovim API (it no longer supports Vim 9).
The color palette was adjusted, and the list of highlight groups was also updated.

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

Sometimes you need to print a Lua table via the command line, but typing something like this
`:lua vim.pretty_print(vim.fs)` can be verbose. You can use the following as a shortcut syntax: `:lua = vim.fs` and get
the same result! The `:lua = x` will always execute `x` and then pretty-print it.

Pretty convenient, don’t you think?
