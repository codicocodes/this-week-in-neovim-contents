This new Colorscheme plugin supports the latest features, such as Treesitter and LSP, while resembling GitHub's VSCode 
themes and following primer design guidelines. It includes GitHub's colorblind themes, supports multiple plugins and 
status lines, and ensures compatibility with various functionalities. The configuration provides a minimal inactive Vim 
Default statusline, Vim terminal colors, and a darker background for sidebar-like windows. It is highly configurable 
with template overriding, offering the most elegant lualine theme. Additionally, it compiles the user's configuration 
for fast startup times, exports the Color library utility, and enables interactive live config re-loading.
