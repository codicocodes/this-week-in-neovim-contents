`mini.nvim` plugin got its module number 30 - `mini.hipatterns`. It can be used to highlight patterns in text (like
`TODO`, hex color strings, etc.) with configurable patterns and highlight groups (both can be string or callable).
Highlighting is updated asynchronously with configurable debounce delay.

> Neovim motions on speed!

It’s been a long time the project hasn’t really moved. There are still a couple of bugs crawling around and I,
[@phaazon](https://github.com/phaazon), didn’t have the time to fix them. Especially now that I’m not using Neovim that
anymore, I don’t really have a big incentive in doing so.

So this is a deprecation notice. Of course, **since the project is licensed with BSD-3-Clause**, feel free to fork it if you
liked it. Initially, I thought about giving commit rights to motivated people but I’m not sure it’s a good idea
anymore.

Hop was one — if not the first? — motion plugin brought to Neovim in Lua, after I realized we had issues with the
original EasyMotion from Vim and the Neovim virtual text / buffer content. Hop fixed those issues, and a wide variety
of other motion plugins started to appear, with different and interesting approaches. Thanks for having used it!

> If you happen to fork and get traction, feel free to reach out to me; I’ll mention the « fork to follow. »
