A `mini.bracketed` module of `mini.nvim` implements functionality and mappings
to go forward/backward with square brackets. This is a Lua evolution of
[tpope/vim-unimpaired](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired) with **much more targets**:

There are a lot of plugins out there to help with sending Python code to a REPL, but not a lot of plugins helps extracting the benefit of interactive coding back into Neovim, where your cursor will reside most of the time.
This is a simple plugin that wrap-around python package 'jupyter_client' to provide ergonomic workflow that enhance your coding experience with any Jupyter kernels.

It provides two main features at the moment: provide `jupyter` source for nvim-cmp autocompletion and a command `:JupyterInspect` to query jupyter kernel information about object under the cursor.

Interacting with Neovim's lua api in Rust can be a bit of a pain. `nvim-utils` aims to make it easier and quicker to 
develop Neovim plugins in Rust by removing as much of the required boilerplate as possible, and implementing bindings 
for the `vim.*` lua api.

`smart-splits.nvim` added support for swapping buffers directionally! Using the same logic as the existing directional window movement and resizing features, swap a window's buffer with the buffer from the window adjacent to it!

> Lua powered Remote Resource Interface

For those who are unfamiliar, Netman is a Framework that provides abstracted access to remote filesystems through a 
standardized API.

![Neo-tree Integration of Remote Filesystems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2640668/221367566-97a71fb7-5ba8-4344-8251-f78af8d61ffc.png)

Netman has completed (and merged) its v1.1 update. Below is a nonexhaustive change log from v1.0 to v1.1

- [Mostly complete Neo-tree integration](https://imgur.com/a/yzTDcQL) (Note, as of current the neo-tree integration is 
  still beta and does not recognize your neo-tree configuration).
- [Moving files and directories between hosts (including between docker containers and ssh servers)](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/issues/115).
- [Auto opening your remote "home" directory in ssh](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/issues/110).
- [A complete rewrite of how "integration" with neovim works](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/pull/67).
- [A completely new logging system](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/issues/79).
- [A new event system](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/issues/77).
- [Updated API Documentation](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/wiki/API-Documentation).
- [Updated Help Docs](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/blob/main/doc/netman.txt).

And there is a ton more! The big thing is that most of the leg work is now done for UI integrations, and quite a bit of 
documentation was updated for the new changes
**[There is a caveat to this, currently netman does not support asynchronous anything :(](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/issues/117)**

Next Milestone is [v1.15](https://github.com/miversen33/netman.nvim/milestone/5) which will consist of some more minor 
updates to prep for more UI integrations (and maybe more providers? 👀).

[Last week](https://this-week-in-neovim.org/2023/Feb/20#update-feline.nvim), the author of `feline.nvim` announced that
the plugin was discontinued and no longer maintained. This week brings a happier news: its development was moved to
[@freddiehaddad](https://github.com/freddiehaddad)! The important thing regarding the original author, 
[@Famiu](https://github.com/famiu), is that they wanted the project to be forked instead of transferring the full 
ownership of the project.

You are then advised to make the migration to the new GitHub repository.
