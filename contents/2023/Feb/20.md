# [Neovim Core updates](#core) {#core}

> Updates of [Neovim](https://neovim.org) itself, which are available on Neovim nightly.

> **Important**: if you are a plugin author, you are strongly advised to follow the
> [#14090 breaking changes on master](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14090) GitHub thread, as it contains
> important breaking changes information.

- [#22257](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/22257) removed the (undocumented) `vim.g.ts_highlight_lua` variable 
  that enabled treesitter highlighting for Lua files. 
  
  This variable was only meant for easier testing during the last development cycle.
  To enable treesitter highlighting for Lua files (or any of the file types with a bundled parser), either put 
  `vim.treesitter.start()` in a `.config/nvim/ftplugin/lua.lua` (and/or `help.lua`, `c.lua`, `vim.lua`) or in an 
  autocommand like:

  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
    pattern = 'lua', -- or { 'lua', 'help' },
    callback = function() vim.treesitter.start() end,
  })
  ```

[Elijah Manor](https://twitter.com/elijahmanor) published a new YouTube video 
[LazyVim: Tailwind CSS Support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NiWhZeR-MY) where he builds upon the base 
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) configuration to add support for Tailwind CSS. He leverages the 
`tailwindcss-language-server` LSP, and  `NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua` for buffer colorization , and 
`roobert/tailwindcss-colorizer-cmp.nvim` for color swatches in the auto-completion. You can find his final configuration 
from the video in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elijahmanor/youtube-lazyvim-tailwind).

If you already use Telescope or FZF-Lua for a nice `vim.ui.select`, and want a nice `vim.ui.input` (e.g.
handling LSP rename), then this simple plugin might work.

It is only about ~50 lines of code, so you could either include the plugin or just copy the code to your config.

`splitjoin.nvim` handles a common task when editing code: splitting and joining lists. The plugin is inspired by the 
venerable old [vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus) and is similar to the older, more 
established, but _envimscriptened_ [SplitJoin.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim) by Andrew Radev.

It features a comprehensive usage of syntax scopes and color consistency, with due regards to aesthetics, contrast and readability.
There is a light and dark variant, it's customizeable and most popular plugins are also supported!

This is a port of the popular Visual Studio Code Themes [Bluloco Light](https://github.com/uloco/theme-bluloco-light)

Do you dislike writing Neovim plugins in Lua? Imagine writing your plugins in a strictly typed language. It has been
possible to write Neovim plugins in different languages, transpiling them to Lua (example with 
[Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) for `emacs` aficionados). This new plugin written by 
[@danielo515](https://github.com/danielo515) is more of a [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) library than a real Neovim plugin.
It allows you to write your plugins in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), which is pretty cool!

Good job!

If only one could easily browse and preview json files in neovim. Oh wait, `nvim-jqx` does just that! `nvim-jqx` is your 
Neovim interface to json and yaml files: in the last release, the author has fixed a few bugs introduced by the latest 
changes in `yq` grammar and have added treesitter syntax highlight to the floating buffer.

The plugin author made a public announcement regarding the maintainance status of the plugin. `feline.nvim` is no
longer maintained and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/feline-nvim/feline.nvim) has been archived. This is a
sad news and we wish the author, [@Famiu](https://github.com/famiu), a good amount of rest and not to let go of making
their projects open-source and public. FOSS **is hard**, more often than we think, and this kind of dilemma happens all
the time. Don’t formalize too much and get well!

If you were using `feline.nvim` as a statusline, several alternatives exist:

- You can make yours on your own if you don’t want to be too fancy. See the [Did you know?](#tips) section for more.

> A bridge between `mason.nvim` and `nvim-dap`.

Major changes have happened lately in the Mason ecosystem. Non exhaustive list:

- `ensure_installed` accepts what `null-ls` and `nvim-dap` accept and not the name in `mason`.
- `mason-null-ls` is able to install new sources automatically as long as the casing follows `SOURCE_NAME`, this would 
  look for SOURC`E-NAME` in `mason.nvim`.
  - This allows less maintenance gith the introduction of new tools in both plugins.
- `setup_handler` has been ported over from `mason-lspconfig`.
- `mason-nvim-dap` is able to setup adapters and its configurations with sensible and overridable defaults.
- Both adhere to SemVer.
- Several adapters have been added `mason-nvim-dap`.
- Automatic_setup sets up the resource for you!

# [Did you know?](#tips) {#tips}

You can setup your own statusline without having to rely on a plugin. Even though the operation is slightly more 
complex than just customizing a statusline plugin, it’s not really rocket science. You have two options:

- Set your statusline to a simple string, using the various out-of-the-box interpolation variables.
- Set your statusline to a string starting with `%!` to execute a function that will be run everytime the statusline
  needs to be rerendered.

The builtin variables are pretty symbol to figure out and include things like:

- Path to the file in the buffer.
- The modified / readonly / etc. flags.
- Type of the buffer.
- Buffer number.
- Line / column / window number.
- Percentage in the file the vertical position is at.
- Various grouping mechanisms.

For more information, have a look at `:help stl`.
