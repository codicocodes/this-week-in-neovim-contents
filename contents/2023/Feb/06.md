Nikfp wrote a blog post a few weeks ago outlining what to expect for the Neovim-curious and anyone who's frustrated with 
their current editor. The article touches on what Vim / Neovim is and goes in depth about Nik's experience making the 
switch. Also included are some resources for people as they dive in and join the fun. It's a lenghty article, but it 
should prove helpful to anyone getting started or considering making a change.

A Neovim plugin to show the currently selected node type from LSP and treesitter information.

The demo shows this plugin being used in several ways:

- Using the lualine statusline integration to show the node-type info in the statusline.
- Via a keybinding.
- Via a call to the plugin API.

Actually a Zsh plugin, which runs a command starting with `:` as an Ex-command and echoes the result.

The Ex-command runs on an existing Neovim session, which is by default a parent Neovim session when Zsh is in the Neovim's 
terminal. The Neovim session can be elsewhere, such as one on a different Tmux' pane from a Zsh session.

This week, [@Tummetott](https://github.com/Tummetott) made a new plugin that avoids the clutter of multiple highlighted 
screen lines with split windows by disabling the cursorline and cursorcolumn settings for inactive windows (unfocused). 
Unlike a simplistic solution with a few autocmds, this plugin still allows for exceptions like disabling the 
`cursorline` or `cursorcolumn` for a particular filetype or making it permanent for other filetypes. Furthermore, this 
plugin supports highlighting the (less intrusive) `cursorline` number in all split windows, while the `cursorline` is 
displayed only in the focused pane.

Congrats on the plugin!
