> Unlist hidden buffers that are git ignored.

![bufignore-plugin.nvim](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2284724/232234047-e170007b-7f31-4e6b-b727-ec62a0196710.mp4)

Introducing `bufignore.nvim`, a efficient plugin that helps you keep your buffer list tidy by automatically unlisting hidden Git ignored files. If you've ever found yourself annoyed by a cluttered buffer list, for example, when working with files within .git or node_modules, then this plugin is for you.

Bufignore comes with several features to help keep your buffer in check, including efficient event processing, support for changing the current working directory, and a customizable callback function to further configure which buffers should be unlisted. It works out-of-the-box without the need for additional configuration.

> A substitute of vim's `:substitute` that uses __lua patterns instead of vim regex__. Supports incremental preview. 

For those of us who started using nvim after the introduction of lua and therefore never learned vimscript. (And do not want to learn it just for `:substitute`.)

__Features__
- Incremental preview of the substitution.
- Supports ranges, with `%` as default.
- The `g` flag is supported and works like with `:substitute`. 
- New flags: `i` for case-insensitive search and `f` for fixed strings (literal strings).

```text
:%s /\(\w\+\)\d\+/\1/g          -- :substitute
:S /(%w+)%d+/%1/g               -- :AltSubstitute
deviceModel2020 -> deviceModel  -- effect
```
