Backseat uses GPT to highlight and explain code readability issues under each line of code. 

Run `:Backseat` to send the current buffer to the OpenAI API for `gpt-3.5-turbo` or gpt-4, which responds with line 
numbers and their matching issues/suggestions. The plugin then highlights those lines with sign column icons and virtual 
text. 

You can also do `:BackseatAsk <question>` to ask the AI a question about the current buffer, such as
`:BackseatAsk Can you identify any issues in redo()?`.

You can get an API key with a free OpenAI account, and after free credits run out, usage of `gpt-3.5-turbo` though the
OpenAI API currently costs ~$0.004 per 100 lines of code used with backseat.

This is my first time writing a plugin or using lua, issues and PRs welcome!

> üß† Smart, directional Neovim and `tmux`/`wezterm`/`kitty` split resizing and navigation. Think about splits in terms 
> of "up/down/left/right".

`smart-splits.nvim` now supports seamless split navigation for the Kitty multiplexer! The plugin will attempt to 
automatically detect your multiplexer backend based on the presence of the following environment variables:

- `$TMUX` => `config.multiplexer_integration = 'tmux'`
- `$WEZTERM_PANE` => `config.multiplexer_integration = 'wezterm'`
- `$KITTY_LISTEN_ON` => `config.multiplexer_integration = 'kitty'` (because Kitty requires listeneing on a socket for remote commands)

Read more about [setting up Kitty's multiplexer integration](https://github.com/mrjones2014/smart-splits.nvim#kitty).

Additionally, `smart-splits.nvim` now supports semantic versioning via git tags.
