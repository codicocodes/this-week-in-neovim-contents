Introducing `dropbar.nvim`, the new winbar plugin designed for neovimmers!
With `dropbar.nvim`, you can elevate your neovim experience to an IDE-like level. This standalone plugin offers support 
for various sources, including LSP (Language Server Protocol) and tree-sitter, enabling seamless integration with your 
coding workflow.

The plugin boasts a user-friendly interface with clickable items, allowing you to navigate through your code 
effortlessly. Not only can you use your mouse for interaction, but you can also leverage the keyboard in pick mode to
efficiently navigate the available options.

One of the standout features of `dropbar.nvim` is its hierarchical structure display. The drop-down menu presents a 
clear overview of the symbol hierarchy in your code, enabling quick navigation and understanding of the codebase.
Customizability is at the heart of `dropbar.nvim`. Tailor the appearance of the winbar and drop-down menu to your
liking, and fine-tune other aspects of the plugin's behavior. Additionally, you have the freedom to choose your 
preferred sources for the winbar or even create your own sources.

As `dropbar.nvim` is still in its early stages, your feedback is invaluable.

> tldr: Otter.nvim provides lsp features and a code completion source for code embedded in other documents

Otter.nvim has been released for more than a week but the author is currently promoting it a bit on reddit so thats why its mentoined here.

Introducing otter.nvim, the solution to harnessing the full power of language features in embedded code blocks!
When code is embedded as blocks within a document, it often lacks the comprehensive language support typically available for pure files. That's where otter.nvim comes to the rescue. This innovative plugin creates and synchronizes hidden buffers, called otter buffers, each dedicated to a single language.
By directing requests for code completion, documentation hover windows, and diagnostics from the main buffer to these otter buffers, otter.nvim ensures that you can enjoy all the cool language features you would typically have for a pure file. The plugin seamlessly integrates these language features into your editing experience, regardless of the context.
With otter.nvim, you no longer have to compromise on functionality when working with embedded code. It enables you to work efficiently and effectively, with all the assistance and insights provided by language servers and intelligent code analysis.
Experience the best of both worlds with otter.nvim. Unlock the full potential of your embedded code blocks and enjoy the same rich language features you would expect from working with pure files. Boost your productivity and code with confidence using otter.nvim.

This is can be used in other plugins as seen in: [quarto-nvim](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-nvim).

It achieves this by reducing the usage of blue and purple colors to minimize eye strain, while emphasizing red, yellow, and green for better readability.
The comments are specifically styled to ensure good contrast with other text and the background, enhancing legibility.
Additionally, bamboo.nvim extends support to various plugins, carefully selecting appropriate colors to maintain consistency across different tools.
One of the notable aspects of bamboo.nvim is its customizability, allowing users to tweak colors, highlights, and code styles to suit their preferences. Overall, bamboo.nvim offers a modified take on the onedark colorscheme, delivering a visually comfortable and personalized coding environment in Neovim.

> A neovim plugin that lets you easily create Telescope pickers from arbitrary console commands.

A one off picker can now be created by calling

```lua
require('easypick').one_off('type your command here')
```

This will open up a picker just for the typed in command with default selection action and previewer

> Automagically close the unedited buffers in your bufferlist when it becomes too long.

In the new release we introduce a telescope picker which is similar to telescope buffer picker but with additional hbac features such as displaying pin state, toggling pin state and deleting buffers.

Also we adjusted the order in which buffers get auto-closed so that if you have any unnamed buffers those will be closed first.
